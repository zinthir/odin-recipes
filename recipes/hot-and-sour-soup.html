            <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add stock, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, soy sauce, and chicken/pork to a 
                large stockpot. Bring to a simmer on medium-high heat. While
                the soup is heating, use a small bowl to hydrate the lily buds in 2 cups water.</li>
            <li>Whisk the cornstarch into the water until both fully incorporate into a slurry. 
                Once the soup is at a simmer, while stirring the soup, pour in the cornstarch slurry. 
                Continue stirring the soup for a minute or so until it noticeably thickens.</li>
            <li>While gently stirring the soup, slowly pour in the egg to create egg ribbons. Add lily buds, discarding the water. 
                Add tofu, sesame oil, black vinegar, and white pepper. Balance the salt, sour and heat to taste by adding additional 
                soy sauce, black vinegar, and white pepper respectively. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately. Garnish with green onions.
